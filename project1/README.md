For the autocomplete function, I capture tab keystrokes using readline() or a similar input handling system. When triggered, I first build two arrays: one for built-in commands and another for executables in PATH directories. Given partial input like "cmd", I use strncmp() to find matches in these arrays. I maintain a trie data structure of possible completions, allowing efficient prefix matching. If there are multiple matches, I find the longest common prefix by comparing characters one by one. If no command matches are found, I use opendir() and readdir() to list files in the current directory. I also integrate this function with the shell's line editing by using appropriate terminal control sequences.

For the kuhex function, I open the target file in binary read mode using fopen(). For each line of 16 bytes that I read, I print three sections: the offset in hexadecimal, the hex dump, and the ASCII representation. For the hex dump section, I handle grouping based on the -g parameter (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes), using bit manipulation to group bytes accordingly. For the ASCII section, I map each byte to its printable representation, using . for non-printable characters. I use sprintf() to format the hex values and ensure proper alignment with printf's field width specifiers. I continue processing until I either reach EOF or encounter an error.

For the is_duplicate function, I scan the /proc filesystem and use process management to detect running instances. I open /proc and iterate through its numerical directories (representing PIDs) using readdir(). For each process, I read /proc/[pid]/cmdline to check if it is another instance of the dash shell. I compare process start times from /proc/[pid]/stat to determine uniqueness. This function returns a boolean value indicating whether another instance exists, which is critical for kernel module management.

In the list_cd function, I handle special cases like cd - (previous directory) and cd (home directory) by maintaining a stack of visited directories. For regular paths, I resolve relative paths to absolute ones using realpath(). Before changing directories, I check their accessibility with access() using the R_OK|X_OK flags. To change directories, I use chdir() and update the PWD and OLDPWD environment variables using setenv(). If an error occurs, such as when trying to access a non-existent directory, I set appropriate errno values and print error messages using perror().

For the psvis_command function, I first check if the kernel module is loaded by attempting to open /proc/psvis. If the module isn’t found, I use system() to run sudo insmod and load it. I then read process information from the kernel module through the /proc interface, which provides a string containing PID, PPID, and process name triplets. I parse this data into a tree structure using a custom struct with pointers to child processes. For visualization, I generate a DOT language description of the tree and pipe it to Graphviz using popen() to create the final image. I use attributes like shape=box and proper edge connections to show the process hierarchy.

The core functionality relies on the write_process_tree function, where I recursively traverse the process tree starting from a given task_struct. I use the Linux kernel's list_head structure and list_for_each macro to iterate through each process's children. For each process, I output its information (PID and name/command) in DOT graph format using seq_printf to safely write to a sequence file. I represent parent-child relationships as directed edges in the graph using the syntax "parent" -> "child". This recursive approach ensures that I capture the entire subtree under the specified process.

The module interacts with user space through the /proc filesystem by creating a file named psvis_tree. To specify a PID, I allow users to write to this file, performing input validation and copying data from user space using copy_from_user. To read the process tree, I handle user requests with the psvis_show function. I convert the stored PID string to an integer, look up the corresponding task_struct using find_get_pid and pid_task, and generate the complete DOT format graph by calling write_process_tree. I use the seq_file interface (with proc_ops) to handle the potentially large output efficiently, breaking it into sequences that can be read iteratively. I manage the module’s lifecycle with psvis_init for initialization and psvis_exit for cleanup, including creating and removing the /proc file entry.
